In this project, "It is required to build a Matlab Simulator to generate the eye diagrams of binary and 4-level PAM signaling, employing various pulse shapes. The objective of the project is to use the eye diagram to test the vulnerability of various signaling schemes to ISI and AWGN."

Four Pulse shapes are employed: (NRZ, RZ, Ideal Nyquist Pulse (Rect), and Raised-Cosine Pulse)

2 and 4-PAM Noisy and Noiseless Eye Diagrams are generated.

Run the 'CIE431Phase2Testing.m'section by section following with the Project Requirements.
